## ðŸ“œ License

I don't want to add license for this repo because I'm scared about my code can be stolen. I want to run it as commercial someday but now I don't have a possibility to do this(money). This repo is public because I want to show my potential employer what Iâ€™m capable of and what kind of fruit am I :)
